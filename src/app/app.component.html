        <span>SENIOR SOLUTIONS ARCHITECT </span>
      </p>
      <h1><span>ABOUT ME</span></h1>
      <p><span>I have been mad about computers since I played around with DOS on my first Amstrad. I build them, program them and am fascinated by them. My biggest regret was listening to my dad in 2001 when I announced my intention to study Computer Science and being told the dot com crash had ended the industry. I was that naive 18 year old! Luckily the force was too strong and after completing a very complicated maths degree, it was my computer skills that shone and led me to become the engineer I am today. I started my career doing data entry and decided I could automate my job, so I did. Far from losing my job I became the most in-demand employee in the department. I have taken that spirit with me through my entire career and have been rewarded with success and the praise of my peers.</span></p>

      <h1><span>EXPERIENCE</span></h1>
      <h2><span>Sequel Business Solutions, </span><span>London &mdash; Solutions Architect</span></h2>
      <h3><span>JANUARY&nbsp;2016 - PRESENT</span></h3>
      <p><span>Sequel has grown from being a trusted consultancy to becoming a leading insurance and reinsurance software specialist.

      <h5><span>Projects</span></h5>
      <h6><span>DEVOPS</span></h6>
      <p><span>When I joined Sequel they were using several different source control, build, test, deployment and project management systems which slowed velocity and impacted quality</span>
        <span>. I have lead the formation of a new strategy which is being rolled out across the company.</span>
      </p>
      <h4><span>TFS, Git, Powershell, C#, XAML</span></h4>

      </ul>

      <h6><span>CLAIMS</span></h6>
      <p><span>Claims is one of the newest products at Sequel and in its short life has become one of the most popular. However, due to the speed at which it was engineered a lot of technical debt had built up and the products stability was very poor. This had led to client complaints and I was assigned to lead the development team and get quality under control. </span></p>
      <h4><span>TFS, Git, Powershell, C#, Typescript, Angular.js, Selenium, Jasmin</span></h4>
      <ul>

        <li><span>Assigned a product owner to lead priorities of bug fixes and new requirements to maximise client satisfaction</span></li>
        <li><span>Enforced daily standups to encourage communication and understanding of product goals for the development team</span></li>
        <li><span>Implemented a feature branch and pull request process to ensure code could not be merged into the product without passing 100% of tests </span></li>
        <li><span>Implemented continuous delivery to build, test and deploy Claims automatically </span></li>

        <li><span>Implemented code analysis tools to measure code quality and levels of technical debt</span></li>
        <li><span>Dramatically increased velocity and the overall quality of the product </span></li>
      </ul>

      <h5><span>Projects </span></h5>
      <h6><span>DEVOPS</span></h6>
      <p><span>When I joined BRT there was no source control, no concept of project management and no devops. These were the first things that I put in place.</span></p>
      <h4><span>Redmine, Gitlab, Thoughtworks Go</span></h4>
      <ul>
        <li><span>Introduced Scrum, sprints and sprint planning</span></li>
        <li><span>Introduced Project management (Redmine), source control (Gitlab) and &nbsp;continuous integration (Thoughtworks Go)</span></li>
        <li><span>Discouraged outsourcing in favour of co-location </span></li>
        <li><span>Introduced code reviews and style guides</span></li>
      </ul>
      <h6><span>CUSTODIAN DATA</span></h6>
      <p><span>BRT&rsquo;s clients receive data files from many sources containing transaction, position and market data. The purpose of the project was to simplify the gathering, extraction and processing of this data.</span></p>
      <h4><span>Windows services, C#, Entity Framework, Autofac, SqlServer.Smo, QuickFix</span></h4>
      <ul>
        <li><span>Code-first Entity framework database for FTP and file extraction configuration</span></li>
        <li><span>Replaced SSIS with Delimited, XML and Excel to SQL translators</span></li>

        <li><span>Trade posting services to multiple portfolio management systems</span></li>
      </ul>
      <h6><span>FUND DEALING DATABASE</span></h6>
      <p><span>BRT&rsquo;s clients trade mainly in funds and require reliable centralised dealing information about a funds dealing times, minimum subscriptions and many other data points.</span></p>
      <h4><span>C#, Entity Framework, Autofac, Web Api, Breeze.js, Require.js, Angular.js, Typescript, HTML5, Less </span></h4>
      <ul>
        <li><span>Code-first database to house data relating funds</span></li>
        <li><span>N-tier architecture with database, data access, business logic and api layers &nbsp;</span></li>
      </ul>
      <h6><span>CLIENT REPORTING</span></h6>
      <p><span>BRT&rsquo;s client reporting solutions were engineered on a client by client basis and there was no consistency between entities and the databases driving them. The purpose of this project was to create a unified reporting database that could be populated from any of the three portfolio management systems in use and any future ones.</span></p>
      <h4><span>Windows services, C#, Entity Framework, Autofac, Web Api, SSRS</span></h4>
      <ul>
        <li><span>Code-first database to house data relating to CRM, portfolios, instruments, pricing, trading, reporting, reconciliation and user workflow</span></li>

      </ul>
      <h6><span>SINGLE SIGN-ON</span></h6>
      <p><span>BRT&rsquo;s legacy systems had individual authentication and role management systems. The purpose of this project was to create a single sign-on application that handled authentication and role management across all existing and future BRT applications.</span></p>
      <h4><span>C#, Entity Framework, Autofac, Web Api, ASP.Net Identity, Thinktecture IdentityServer, WebApi, MVC, Razor</span></h4>
